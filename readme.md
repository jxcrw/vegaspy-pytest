# VegasPy Python Testing with Pytest

Code and slides for the VegasPy August 2023 meeting.

This talk is based on the book [Python Testing with Pytest (Second Edition) by Brian Okken](https://pragprog.com/titles/bopytest2/python-testing-with-pytest-second-edition/), and includes many examples drawn from my [personal readthrough of the book](https://github.com/jxcrw/navi/tree/main/python/pytest-okken) in addition to the example code included directly in this repo.

For more information about the VegasPy group, see the [main VegasPy repo](https://github.com/jxcrw/vegaspy).
